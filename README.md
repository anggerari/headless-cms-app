# Headless CMS with TALL Stack - Palmcode Technical Test

This project is a fully functional Headless Content Management System (CMS) built as a technical test for the Senior Laravel Developer position at Palmcode. It features a robust admin panel for content management and a versioned REST API to deliver content to any frontend application.

---

## Features Implemented

### Core Features
- [x] **Authentication**: Secure admin-only login powered by Laravel Jetstream with the Teams feature enabled for RBAC.
- [x] **Content Management**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for:
    - [x] **Posts**: Includes title, content, excerpt, featured image, and status management.
    - [x] **Pages**: For managing static content.
    - [x] **Categories**: With a many-to-many relationship to Posts.
- [x] **Dynamic Admin UI**: The entire admin panel is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using the TALL stack (Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Livewire, Laravel) for a fast, modern, and reactive user experience.
- [x] **Public REST API**: A versioned (`/api/v1/`) RESTful API to expose all published content.
    - [x] Endpoints for Posts, Pages, and Categories.
    - [x] Slug-based routing for user-friendly and SEO-friendly URLs.
- [x] **API Documentation**: Automatically generated, interactive API documentation using Scribe.

### Bonus Features
- [x] **Media Manager**: A dedicated section to upload, view, and delete images from a central library.
- [x] **Reusable Blocks / Custom Fields (Backend Implementation)**: The database schema and models have been prepared with flexible `JSON` columns on the `posts` and `pages` tables. This provides a scalable foundation for adding custom fields in the future without requiring database migrations. The API resources are also configured to expose this data.

### 5. Run Database Migrations & Seeding
This command will create all the necessary tables and populate the database with an initial admin user and some sample content.
```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

### 6. Link Storage
This command creates a symbolic link from `public/storage` to `storage/app/public`, which is necessary for uploaded images to be publicly accessible.
```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

### 7. Start the Servers
You need to run two servers in separate terminal windows: the PHP server and the Vite asset server.

**Terminal 1: Start the Laravel Server**
